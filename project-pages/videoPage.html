        <div class="body-text">After having done some classes on Java and data structures, I had wanted to do something
          with creating an MMORPG due to my prolonged
          interest in video games. I had wanted to create a game that was simple, yet fun to play, and I thought that a
          text-based RPG would be a good start. I had also wanted to create a game that was open-world, so that players
          could explore and discover new things.

        </div>
        <div class="body-text">With that vision, I began with layering out the basics and what was needed to be done.
          This project was composed in a span of 8 months. Credits to some of
          my classmates and friends who helped me with the project, such as helping me with the design and some of the
          code. I had also used some online resources to help me with the code, such as Stack Overflow.
